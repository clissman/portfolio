                    <p>Cloud storage services can be <strong>cluttered and confusing</strong>, interfering with work. Lack of options when sharing and
                    collaborating can frustrate the process and create unnecessary slow-downs in productivity, while useful features like
                    <strong>version control go unnoticed and unused</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class='smallest'>User Research</h3>
                    <p>To learn more about people using cloud storage, I first conducted a user survey to help understand <strong>people’s goals,
                    problems, and barriers</strong>. A total of fifty-three respondents participated, and although several of their frustrations
                    related to price and storage, many actionable problems presented themselves, including:</p>
                    <ul class='list--bulleted'>
                        <li>Difficulty organizing files</li>
                        <li>Being unaware of version control</li>
                        <li>Finding the interface complicated</li>
                        <li>Not being able to easily see the number of files in a folder</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="paragraph_description">Cloud Storage is popular</h4>
                    <p>Cloud storage use was extremely high due in part to internet recruitment functioning as a screener. Respondents were
                    also generally young and living in metropolitan areas, and were <strong>very comfortable using computers</strong>. The majority <strong>used
                    cloud storage daily</strong>.</p>

                    <p>One of the more intriguing discoveries of the user survey was that people <strong>rarely used version control</strong> in their cloud
                    storage but had a <strong>strong interest in it</strong>.</p>

                    <p>To learn more about the features people did and didn't like in their current cloud storage, I analyzed the three most
                    popular services found in the user survey with a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F159_5qDThcHDVQX1hqBsS9YDDE2Yq5O6mTpV8WCER4/edit?usp=sharing' target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive analysis</a>.

                    and participants felt that the onboarding messaging could be improved. I then ranked problems and solutions in an

                    usability tests</p>

                    <p>To develop the Cira brand, I started with a mind-map to discover associations between the user personas and cloud
                    storage. This led me to the name Cira, which is derived from the Latin word <i>cirrus</i> and alludes to both clouds and branching. Using the map's links and the attributes <strong>fun, adventurous, and playful</strong>, I quickly sketched out several ideas
                    for the Cira logo.</p>

                    <p>The share modal is one element that changed considerably after user testing uncovered problems. The initial version was
                    frustrating for users because of the field arrangement, the appearance of the permissions dropdown menu, the field and
                    button labels, and the contrast of the placeholder text.</p>
                    <h4 class="paragraph_description">Redesigning for clarity</h4>
                    <p>To solve these problems I placed the permissions option directly next to its corresponding field with dynamic permission
                    labels above, increased the contrast of placeholder text, and changed the wording throughout.</p>
                    <p>I also included subtle variations in cloud motifs in this and other modals to guide users. Because this addition would
                    appear on numerous screens, I preference tested it and found that it was well-received</p>

                    <p>Users found the dashboard easy to use and navigate through, and especially liked that folders displayed the number of
                    items they contained. There was still some difficulty finding the backup and sync option, so it and settings were
                    labeled. I also preference tested different arrangements of images and icons and found a preferred balance between the
                    number and size of items and their spacing.</p>

                    <p>Working on Cira was a great experience and an opportunity to discover user needs in cloud storage. I found where I could
                    improve my process in the future, especially during the strategy phase. I was happy to <strong>identify opportunities to improve
                    Cira’s user interface</strong> after wireframe testing and enjoyed improving sharing features, control, and overall aesthetics.</p>
                    <p>Given more time I’d conduct more ethnographic research, learning more about <strong>cloud storage use in specific contexts</strong>. I’d
                    also observe other people using existing cloud storage to learn more about their likes, frustrations, and methods. In
                    addition to helping develop even more empathetic user stories and representative personas, this would also help provide
                    the vocabulary of users for both the landing page and the interface, as well as make future branding decisions clearer.</p>
