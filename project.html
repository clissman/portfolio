                <p>Cloud storage services can be <strong>cluttered and confusing</strong>, interfering with work. Lack of options when sharing and
                collaborating can frustrate the process and create unnecessary slow-downs in productivity, while useful features like
                <strong>version control go unnoticed and unused</strong>.</p>

                <p>Cira jumps into the crowded cloud storage market with a <strong>clear and intuitive interface, easy sequential version control,
                and real-time collaboration</strong>. Cira also brings some unexpectedly playful features while providing all the staple tools of
                cloud storage.</p>

                <h2 class='larger title'>Discovery</h2>
                <h3 class='smallest'>User Research</h3>
                <p>To learn more about people using cloud storage, I first conducted a user survey to help understand <strong>peopleâ€™s goals,
                problems, and barriers</strong>. A total of fifty-three respondents participated, and although several of their frustrations
                related to price and storage, many actionable problems presented themselves, including:</p>
                <ul class='list--bulleted'>
                    <li>Difficulty organizing files</li>
                    <li>Being unaware of version control</li>
                    <li>Finding the interface complicated</li>
                    <li>Not being able to easily see the number of files in a folder</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="paragraph_description">Cloud Storage is popular</h4>
                <p>Cloud storage use was extremely high due in part to internet recruitment functioning as a screener. Respondents were
                also generally young and living in metropolitan areas, and were <strong>very comfortable using computers</strong>. The majority <strong>used
                cloud storage daily</strong>.</p>
                <p class="graph__title">Do you currently use cloud storage?</p>
                <canvas role='img' aria-label="Chart showing cloud storage use and awareness" id="chart-1"></canvas>
                <h4 class="paragraph_description">An Opportunity for Version Control</h4>
                <p>One of the more intriguing discoveries of the user survey was that people <strong>rarely used version control</strong> in their cloud
                storage but had a <strong>strong interest in it</strong>.</p>
                <p class="graph__title">Which collaboration features would you use if available?</p>
                <canvas role='img' aria-label="Chart showing collaboration feature use" id="chart-2"></canvas>
                <p>The majority of users are interested in version control when its purpose is described to them.</p>
                <p class="graph__title">How interested would you be in version control for your files? Version control is a way of safely modifying a file while
                keeping a master copy.</p>
                <canvas role='img' aria-label="Chart showing interest in version control" id="chart-3"></canvas>
                <p>I decided to make version control a key feature based on these results. Being aware that it is an unfamiliar feature to
                many and platforms like GitHub can be intimidating, I made the process as simple as possible while maintaining its collaborative strength.</p>
                <p>Survey analysis also revealed that:</p>
                <ul class='list--bulleted'>
                    <li>Less than half of people organized their files</li>
                    <li>Expense, privacy, and security are major concerns for many</li>
                    <li>YouTube is the most popular external learning resource, followed by documentation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class='smallest'>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>To learn more about the features people did and didn't like in their current cloud storage, I analyzed the three most
                popular services found in the user survey with a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F159_5qDThcHDVQX1hqBsS9YDDE2Yq5O6mTpV8WCER4/edit?usp=sharing' target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive analysis</a>. I also mapped out user flows for these products to see how they worked and
                the logic behind their differences.</p>

                                for the Cira logo.</p>

                                    <p>Users found the dashboard easy to use and navigate through, and especially liked that folders displayed the number of
                                    items they contained. There was still some difficulty finding the backup and sync option, so it and settings were
                                    labeled. I also preference tested different arrangements of images and icons and
                                    found a <strong>preferred balance</strong> between the
                                    number and size of items and their spacing.</p>

                <p>Working on Cira was a great experience and an opportunity to discover user needs in cloud storage. I found where I could
                improve my process in the future, especially during the strategy phase. I was happy to <strong>identify opportunities to improve
                Ciraâ€™s user interface</strong> after wireframe testing and enjoyed improving sharing features, control, and overall aesthetics.</p>
                <p>To continue the project Iâ€™d conduct more ethnographic research, learning more about <strong>cloud storage use in specific contexts</strong>. Iâ€™d
                also observe other people using existing cloud storage to learn more about their likes, frustrations, and methods. In
                addition to helping develop even more empathetic user stories and representative personas, this would also help provide
                the vocabulary of users for both the landing page and the interface, as well as make future branding decisions clearer.</p>
