                    <p>I am a User Experience Engineer who solves problems to create <strong>human-centered experiences</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've always liked the quote that we can never know enough people, and my favorite thing about design is connecting with
                    others from different backgrounds and discovering their problems and goals. <strong>Understanding others</strong> is the key to creating
                    enjoyable experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p>While earning my degree in chemistry, I found that <strong>I loved solving problems</strong> and working with data, but I wanted to be
                    more creative. After independently learning front-end development, I found myself questioning why some experiences were
                    better than others. I understood how to implement things, but not the reasons behind their design. This curiosity led me
                    to UX Design, and I was happy to discover a field that required a scientific approach combined with creativity.</p>
        
                    <p>My UX process is research-driven and methodical. I use my education in science to be <strong>analytical and precise</strong>, discovering
                    what people need through research then <strong>iterating on solutions</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm especially interested in the consistency and speed offered by <strong>design systems</strong> and create them with the front-end
                    development team in mind.</p>
                    
                    <p>Outside of work, I like to set cryptic crosswords, read, and travel.</p>
